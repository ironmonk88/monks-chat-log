# Monk's Chat Log
Add-On Module for Foundry VTT
Want to have a private chat with another player that doesn't get mixed in with all the other messages in the chat?  
This module will allow you to create new chats seperate from the main chat to keep things more organized, less cluttered and less chance to private messages being accidentaly seen.
